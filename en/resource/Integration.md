## Fast Integration

### Use CocoaPods for quick integration

Add the following content in the `Podfile` file.

```ruby
source "https://github.com/TuyaInc/TYPublicSpecs.git"
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'

platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'your_target_name' do
   pod "TuyaSmartPanelSDK"
   # If you need the sweeper, please rely on the relevant plug-in of the sweeper
   pod "TuyaRNApi/Sweeper"
end
```

Then run the `pod update` command in the root directory of project.
For use of CocoaPods, please refer to the [CocoaPods Guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org/) It is recommended to update the CocoaPods to the latest version.

### Initialize SDK

1. Open project setting, `Target => General`, edit `Bundle Identifier` to the value from Tuya develop center.

2. Import security image to the project and rename as `t_s.bmp`, then add it into `Project Setting => Target => Build Phases => Copy Bundle Resources`.

3. Add the following to the project file `PrefixHeader.pch`, Swift project add the following to the `xxx_Bridging-Header.h` file:

   ```objc
   #import <TuyaSmartBaseKit/TuyaSmartBaseKit.h>
   #import <TuyaSmartPanelSDK/TuyaSmartPanelSDK.h>
   ```

4. Open file `AppDelegate.m`ï¼Œand use the `App Key` and `App Secret` obtained from the development platform in the `[AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:]`method to initialize SDK:

   ObjC

   ```objc
   [[TuyaSmartSDK sharedInstance] startWithAppKey:<#your_app_key#> secretKey:<#your_secret_key#>];
   ```

   Swift

   ```swift
   TuyaSmartSDK.sharedInstance()?.start(withAppKey: <#your_app_key#>, secretKey: <#your_secret_key#>)
   ```

Now all the prepare work has been completed. You can use the sdk to develop your application now.
